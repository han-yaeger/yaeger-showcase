# Yaeger Showcase

The Yaeger Showcase demonstrates all features of Yaeger in an example project.
After running the ShowCase through its main method in the class 
`YaegerShowCase`, it will show a Scene containing a menu for may different 
Scenes. Each of those Scenes demonstrates different features of Yaeger.
